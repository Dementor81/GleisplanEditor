# GleisplanEditor Refactoring Phases

This document tracks the progress of modernizing the GleisplanEditor codebase by breaking down the monolithic `start.js` file into a maintainable, modular architecture.

### Architecture Overview
```
Application (Singleton)
â”œâ”€â”€ EventManager (Event handling)
â”œâ”€â”€ RenderingManager (Rendering operations)
â”œâ”€â”€ UIManager (UI state and behavior)
â””â”€â”€ Core State Management
```

### Key Benefits Achieved So Far
- âœ… Reduced Application class complexity
- âœ… Better separation of concerns
- âœ… Improved maintainability
- âœ… Cleaner architecture
- âœ… Better testability foundation
- âœ… Maintained backward compatibility

## Notes

- All phases maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- Each phase builds upon the previous ones
- The modular architecture makes it easier to implement subsequent phases
- Testing and error handling will be added as the architecture stabilizes
- TypeScript is optional and can be added at any point
